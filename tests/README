These tests are stolen from https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/tree/master/tests.

To run the tests, call `python -mtests.test` from the parent folder.

To add a test:

1. Create a "blah.css" or "blah.js" file.
2. Create a "blah.css.min" or "blah.js.min" file, containing the expected minified output.

That's all!
